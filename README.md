# Open Source R2D2 Periscope Lighting PCB(s)

This open source project is a place to house all information around:
- Purchasing R2D2 periscope lighting PCBs
- Constructing the PCBs
- Uploading Code / Testing PCBs

While there are different assembily options based on cost vs. level of effort, all assembily options assumes you are prepared to do some entry level soldering to complete your periscope lighiting.

## Features
- R2 Uppity Spinner 3 pin communication
- Optional RX/TX communication
- 31x 5v WS2812B-2020 RGB LEDs
- 8 different lighting modes

## Assembily options

Before you get started on purchasing PCBs, you must first decide if you or the manufacturer will be surface mounting the PCB components. Its recommended you review both assembily options first before making any purchase. In both instances you get 5 whole kits, however one is less expensive than the other but requires more work.

- Minimal amount of soldering / Most Expensive
- Most amount of soldering / Least Expensive route

Minimal amount of soldering assembily option is the most expensive option cause the PCB circiut board manufacturer will be doing all the component (RGB LED, capacitors, resitors) for you under a 4 design x5 board run. This leaves you with only having to break out each PCB side, dry fitting them and soldering the through holes where each side edges meet. Upload code, apply power and away you go.

However the cheaper option requires the most amount of soldering and that you have experince at SMD soldering. Instead of the manufacturer doing the soldering you are given a metal stencile that is used in conjunction with low temp solder, heat gun or plate to surface mount self purchased components. This all before even assembiling the sides together, mounting arduino, uploading code and applying power.
